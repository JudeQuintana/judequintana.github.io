      <title>Finally published to public registry</title>

      <description>Hey cloud networkers,
Great news! The modules that power TNT Architecture and Super Router projects for AWS have been published to the Terraform Cloud public registry at v1.0.0, like FINALLY!
The modules are mostly the same as what&amp;rsquo;s in my Terraform development repo at v1.4.9.
This is my contribution to the Terraform community.
I hope it helps.
Ended up moving generate_routes_to_other_vpcs module into the Centralized Router repo modules directory because it&amp;rsquo;s only function of that router, therefore, should be closer.</description>

      <description>Reflection in the Rear-View: Initially, I thought the TNT Architecture project and Super Router project were &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; to scale VPCs and TGWs in AWS.
But, after looking back on what was built there were so many areas for improvement that I could not resist the extended refinement and discovery.
I went ahead and gave the most useful Terraform networking modules a clean chrome wrapping with encoded engravings.
Most of the work went into internal module changes and consolidating my favorite patterns to use.</description>

      <title>$init super refactor</title>

      <description>Aaaand we&amp;rsquo;re back with another heavy hitting round of super refactorization in Terraform!
I think the first iteration of Super Router for AWS went well.
It allowed us to peer and route both intra-region and cross-region TGWs and VPCs with a single module.
But there was one really annoying flaw.
The caveat in the design is that the peer TGWs will have to go through the Super Router&amp;rsquo;s local provider region to get to other peer TGWs.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s up world?!
Welcome back for moar spicy cloud networking Terraform takes because we servin&amp;rsquo; them HOT over here so let&amp;rsquo;s dig in!
This is a follow up to the generating routes blog post.
TNT Architecture Recap The Terraform Networking Trifecta project demonstrated the ability to &amp;ldquo;scale&amp;rdquo; AWS VPCs in Terraform code by adding VPC objects to a list.
Example VPC architecture but with auto named subnets: With Tiered VPCs we can narrow down the context (ie app, cicd, general) and maximize the use of smaller network sizes.</description>

      <description>Intro Initially I&amp;rsquo;d planned to blog more than just about Terraform but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t turned out that way due to lack of time.
But that&amp;rsquo;s OK because I really do enjoy creating and writing about networking topics with Terraform in the cloud.
Content generation is hard so hats off to those who are consistently generating it.
This project is for all the Terraform headz building networks in the cloud!
It&amp;rsquo;s building on my previous Tiered VPC idea but by adding a couple more abstractions we can build flexible networking between multiple AWS VPCs with minimal code.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s Mathematics Dynamic VPC x Tiered Subnet Calculator = Tiered VPC
Observing Abstractions In hindsight, the Dynamic VPC module should instead be called Simple VPC. It provides a general VPC tier including a public subnet (/24), a private subnet (/24) and NAT Gateways per AZ. The interface is simple because there is minimal focus on subnetting due to the internal subnet generation.
Routing is automatic and the module outputs can be consumed for peering.</description>

      <title>Dynamic VPC Module in Terraform 0.12</title>

      <description>TL;DR Just show me the code! This is a Dynamic VPC Module that builds a redundant network architecture in AWS based on structured input using for_each and for constructs. It will build a VPC with private and public subnets per AZ with the proper routing and labeling.
Here is the related VPC network diagram for visual reference. Preface I was planning on releasing this blog post shortly after Terraform 0.12 released but there were unexpected delays.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone,
Great news! The modules that power TNT Architecture and Super Router projects for AWS have been published to the Terraform Cloud public registry at v1.0.0, like FINALLY!
The modules are mostly the same as what&amp;rsquo;s in my Terraform development repo at v1.4.9.
Before (Dev version):
source = &amp;#34;git@github.com:JudeQuintana/terraform-modules.git//networking/tgw_super_router_for_tgw_centralized_router?ref=v1.4.9&amp;#34; After (Terraform Cloud version):
source = &amp;#34;JudeQuintana/super-router/aws&amp;#34; version = &amp;#34;1.0.0&amp;#34; This is my contribution to the Terraform and Cloud Networking communities.</description>

      <description>Reflection in the Rear-View: Initially, I thought the TNT Architecture project and Super Router project were &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; to scale VPCs and TGWs in AWS.
But, after looking back on what was built there were so many areas for improvement that I could not resist the extended refinement and discovery.
I went ahead and gave the most useful Terraform networking modules a clean chrome wrapping with encoded engravings.
Most of the work went into internal module changes and consolidating my favorite patterns to use.</description>

      <description>Intro Initially I&amp;rsquo;d planned to blog more than just about Terraform but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t turned out that way due to lack of time.
But that&amp;rsquo;s OK because I really do enjoy creating and writing about networking topics with Terraform in the cloud.
Content generation is hard so hats off to those who are consistently generating it.
This project is for all the Terraform headz building networks in the cloud!
It&amp;rsquo;s building on my previous Tiered VPC idea but by adding a couple more abstractions we can build flexible networking between multiple AWS VPCs with minimal code.</description>

      <description>Reflection in the Rear-View: Initially, I thought the TNT Architecture project and Super Router project were &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; to scale cross-region VPCs and TGWs in AWS.
But, after looking back on what was built there were so many areas for improvement that I could not resist the extended refinement and discovery.
I went ahead and gave the most useful Terraform networking modules a clean chrome wrapping with encoded engravings.</description>

      <description>Aaaand we&amp;rsquo;re back with another heavy hitting round of super refactorization in Terraform!
I think the first iteration of Super Router for AWS went well.
It allowed us to peer and route both intra-region and cross-region TGWs and VPCs with a single module.
But there was one really annoying flaw.
The caveat in the design is that the peer TGWs will have to go through the Super Router&amp;rsquo;s local provider region to get to other peer TGWs.</description>

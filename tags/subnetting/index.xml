      <title>Terraform Networking Trifecta</title>

      <description>Intro Initially I&amp;rsquo;d planned to blog more than just about Terraform but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t turned out that way due to lack of time.
But that&amp;rsquo;s OK because I really do enjoy creating and writing about networking topics with Terraform in the cloud.
Content generation is hard so hats off to those who are consistently generating it.
This project is for all the Terraform headz building networks in the cloud!
It&amp;rsquo;s building on my previous Tiered VPC idea but by adding a couple more abstractions we can build flexible networking between multiple AWS VPCs with minimal code.</description>

      <title>Tiered Subnet Calculator in Terraform</title>

      <description>Update May 6th 2023:
Things have changed for the Tiered Subnet Calculator module since Terraform v0.13.0 like the resulting order (lexical sorting) of a set of objects with for.
variable &amp;#34;tiers&amp;#34; { description = &amp;#34;Networking tiers&amp;#34; type = set(object({ name = string acl = string newbit = number })) } Using a list of objects will keep it&amp;rsquo;s current order so I can use the var.base_cidr_block as a starting point for generating network subnets for AWS.</description>

      <title>Dynamic VPC Module in Terraform 0.12</title>

      <description>TL;DR Just show me the code! This is a Dynamic VPC Module that builds a redundant network architecture in AWS based on structured input using for_each and for constructs. It will build a VPC with private and public subnets per AZ with the proper routing and labeling.
Here is the related VPC network diagram for visual reference. Preface I was planning on releasing this blog post shortly after Terraform 0.12 released but there were unexpected delays.</description>
